## Why Nova Word

- **Familiar.** Word's ribbon tabs, groups, shortcuts and behaviour: Enter continues a list,
  Tab demotes it, Ctrl/⌘+B bolds the word under the caret, the Styles gallery previews styles live,
  F4 repeats, F7 checks spelling, F8 extends the selection.
- **Your files.** Opens and saves .docx (OOXML), and also .odt, .rtf, .html, .md, .tex (LaTeX), .txt; opens Word 97-2003 .doc; exports PDF
  with real, selectable text, links and bookmarks.
- **Fast.** Paragraph layout is cached, so typing in a 188-page document re-lays it out in about
  1.4 ms; pages render on demand.
- **Everywhere.** One Rust codebase for macOS, Windows, Linux, BSD and the web. No Electron, no
  Tauri: native [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) on the GPU.
- **Built for agents.** Every action is a command with an id. The same 422 commands drive the
  ribbon, keyboard shortcuts, the command search, a command-line tool, a JSON control channel and
  an MCP server.
- **Private.** Spelling, grammar and everything else work offline.
- **Open.** MIT OR Apache-2.0. Clean-room: built from public specifications and observation, with
  every asset original or openly licensed.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EuLucaDev/novaword
cd novaword
cargo run --release -p novaword -- --sample        # the desktop app with the sample document
cargo run --release -p novaword -- report.docx     # open a document
```

Command line:

```sh
novaword-cli convert report.docx report.pdf        # docx, pdf, odt, rtf, html, md, tex, txt, png
novaword-cli text report.docx                      # plain text
novaword-cli inspect report.docx                   # structure as JSON
novaword-cli run --template sample \
  --cmd 'select.text={"text":"Membership"}' --cmd format.bold --save out.docx
```

Web: `cd apps/novaword-web && trunk serve`, then open <http://127.0.0.1:8771/?sample>.

## For agents: CLI and MCP

Nova Word was designed to be driven by people *and* by AI agents.

```sh
claude mcp add novaword -- novaword-cli mcp                  # headless documents
# confine the agent to folders: novaword-cli mcp --automation-read-root DIR --automation-write-root DIR
novaword --control 7981 &                                     # or drive the running app…
claude mcp add novaword-app -- novaword-cli mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7981
```

Tools include `list_commands`, `execute`, `batch`, `type_text`, `select_text`, `inspect_document`,
`render_page`, `save_document`, and, with a running app, `screenshot`, `click` and `key`. Agents
can check their work through `inspect_document` without screenshots. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md)
and the [control protocol](docs/control-protocol.md). Macros record any sequence of commands and
play it back (`tools.recordMacro`, `tools.macros`).

## Logs

The desktop app writes its log records to standard error and to `logs/novaword.log` next to its
preferences: on Linux `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/novaword/logs/` (by default `~/.config/novaword/logs/`),
on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Nova Word/logs/`, on Windows `%APPDATA%\Nova Word\logs\`.
A start from a desktop menu or the Dock has no terminal, so this file is what to attach to a bug
report: unreadable parts of a .docx, pictures or fonts a PDF export had to leave out and panics the
command guard recovered from land there. Each launch moves the previous log to `novaword.1.log`
(and that one to `novaword.2.log`), so the log of a run that crashed survives the next start; a
log stops growing at 16 MiB. `--version` writes no file, and runs with `NOVAWORD_NO_PREFS` (agents'
test runs) log to standard error only. Document text is never logged; a panic message leaves out
the text it quotes.

By default Nova Word's own crates log at `info` and everything else at `warn`. `RUST_LOG` replaces
that with env_logger-style directives, for example `RUST_LOG=debug`,
`RUST_LOG=warn,novaword_docx=trace` or `RUST_LOG=info,wgpu_core=warn`; a directive ending in `*`
covers every target starting with it (`novaword*=debug`). The logger is
`apps/novaword/src/logging.rs`.

## Architecture

| Layer | Crate | Job |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `novaword-geom` | units and measurements |
| L1 | `novaword-doc`, `novaword-fonts`, `novaword-proof` | document model and editing; fonts and shaping; spelling, grammar, hyphenation |
| L2 | `novaword-layout`, `novaword-docx`, `novaword-formats` | line breaking, pagination, tables, notes, hit testing; OOXML; ODT/RTF/HTML/Markdown/TXT |
| L3 | `novaword-render`, `novaword-pdf` | rasteriser (vello_cpu); PDF ([craft-pdf](docs/shared-pdf.md), Krilla) |
| L4 | `novaword-engine` | session, undo, 422 commands, Word feature catalog |
| L5 | `novaword-mcp` | MCP server |
| L6 | `novaword-ui-egui` | the Word-style front end (swappable) |
| apps | `novaword`, `novaword-cli`, `novaword-web` | desktop, command line, browser |

`cargo xtask ci` runs formatting, clippy, ~800 tests, the asset-attribution check, the layering
check and the wasm build. Contributor and agent instructions: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Roadmap

Nova Word is in **alpha**. It covers 88% of Word's ribbon features with commands today; counting
depth, file fidelity, stability and the rest, we estimate it is about 60% of the way to replacing
all of Word for real work, about 55% for a typical professional's weekly work and about 63% for
everyday essentials. Beta needs testing against real-world .docx files, keeping charts and SmartArt
through a round trip, pagination closer to Word's, a stability sweep and native printing. Details
and estimates: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [where we fall short](docs/gaps.md).

## Downloads

**Download Nova Word** from GitHub: the [latest release](https://github.com/EuLucaDev/novaword/releases/latest) has every build listed below, and [all releases](https://github.com/EuLucaDev/novaword/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `novaword-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `novaword-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `novaword-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `novaword-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `novaword-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `novaword-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed.

**If the app doesn't open on Windows:** the desktop app initializes only DirectX 12 by default.
Letting wgpu also create an OpenGL instance can crash some graphics drivers (AMD's
`atio6axx.dll`) before the window appears, so the app would flash in Task Manager and quit.
`WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the default for troubleshooting (for example `dx12` or `vulkan`). In
PowerShell, from the folder containing the executable:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"
& .\novaword.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_BACKEND                     # restore the default for later launches
```

An explicit `gl` override can bring the driver crash back on affected systems. The macOS, Linux
and web backend defaults are unchanged.

The **32-bit** build uses OpenGL even when a DirectX 12 graphics card is present. On 32-bit
Windows, creating a DirectX 12 graphics pipeline fails immediately and the app exits before the
window appears. `WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan` (or `dx12`) still overrides that.

**If the app quits right after its window appears with "Parent device is lost" in the log:**
Nova Word compiles DirectX 12 shaders with FXC, the compiler built into Windows, so it needs no
`dxcompiler.dll`/`dxil.dll` and ignores any copy another program put on `PATH` (#603).
`WGPU_DX12_COMPILER` (`fxc`, `dxc`, `auto`) overrides this; with `dxc`, a matching
`dxcompiler.dll` *and* `dxil.dll` must sit next to `novaword.exe`. `WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"`
also avoids DirectX 12 altogether.

**If the app is slow on an older Windows PC:** when DirectX 12 finds no graphics card with a
driver for it (for example Intel 4th-generation graphics on Windows 11), it only offers Microsoft's
software renderer, which draws every frame on the processor. In that case Nova Word uses OpenGL
instead, without setting anything. The log file records the choice (lines starting with
`graphics:`). `WGPU_BACKEND` still overrides it, e.g. `$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "gl"` or `"dx12"`.

### macOS

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App, universal (Apple silicon + Intel) | `novaword-<ver>-macos-universal.dmg` | Signed and notarized |
| Command-line tool, universal | `novaword-cli-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` | Signed and notarized |

### Linux

| Format | x86_64 | aarch64 (ARM64) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AppImage | `novaword-<ver>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | `novaword-<ver>-linux-aarch64.AppImage` | Runs anywhere; updates itself with [AppImageUpdate](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate) (`.zsync` files) |
| Flatpak | `novaword-<ver>-linux-x86_64.flatpak` | `novaword-<ver>-linux-aarch64.flatpak` | Sandboxed; `flatpak install --user <file>` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `novaword-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb` | `novaword-<ver>-linux-aarch64.deb` | |
| Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE | `novaword-<ver>-linux-x86_64.rpm` | `novaword-<ver>-linux-aarch64.rpm` | |
| Tarball | `novaword-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `novaword-<ver>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` | Unpack anywhere |

RISC-V (riscv64): `novaword-<ver>-linux-riscv64.tar.gz`, a tarball cross-compiled for glibc 2.39+
(Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13 and newer).

**Wayland:** on a Wayland desktop the app runs through XWayland when it is available, because
winit (the windowing library) supports dragging files into the window only on X11. To use the
native Wayland backend instead (for example for sharper text with fractional scaling, at the cost
of file drag-and-drop), start it with `NOVAWORD_WAYLAND=1`:

```sh
NOVAWORD_WAYLAND=1 novaword
```

**Arch Linux (AUR).** Community members maintain three AUR packages; the project doesn't publish
to the AUR itself. Install one of them:
| Package | What it installs | Choose it when |
|---|---|---|
| [`novaword-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/novaword-bin) | The release tarball above, prebuilt (x86_64, aarch64) | You want the latest release without compiling (quickest) |
| [`novaword`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/novaword) | The latest release, built from source with `cargo` | You prefer to build releases yourself |
| [`novaword-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/novaword-git) | The current `main` branch, built from source | You want unreleased changes and accept an occasional broken build |
For example `yay -S novaword-bin` or `paru -S novaword-bin`.

#### Community packages

These packages are maintained by community members, not by the Nova Word team.

On Gentoo, the [::snakebyte overlay](https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay) packages the
Linux release as `app-office/novaword-bin` (prebuilt) and `app-office/novaword` (built from source):

```sh
eselect repository add snakebyte git https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay.git
emaint sync -r snakebyte
echo 'app-office/novaword-bin ~amd64' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/novaword
emerge --ask app-office/novaword-bin
```

### FreeBSD

| Build | File |
|---|---|
| x86_64 | `novaword-<ver>-freebsd-x86_64.tar.gz` |

### Web (WebAssembly)

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Static site | `novaword-web-<ver>.zip` | Runs in a modern browser; host it on any static server |
